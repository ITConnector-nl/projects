- Search Frameworks - completed
Some examples and tests performed with different Search frameworks in order to create a solution by crawling data and presenting this in a nice interface. Analyzed: SolR, ElasticSearch, MongoDb Atlas, Azure Search. As the project had no limitation where the data was stored, Microsoft Cognitive Search is the chosen solution. The feature to create a website with search page as a demo from an indexer was very helpfull.
